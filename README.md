# Crowd-density-estimate
The code uploaded is the final code that is used for single prediction. 
The program takes input image and imports the weight files from the already trained model. 
The code predicts the crowd density present inside the bus and classifies into five crowd levels: very low, low, moderate, high and very high.
The predicted crowd density is updated at the real-time server as well.
